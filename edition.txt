2018.11.27
  Virtual_Analysis_0.2.2:use multiple GUI to simplify the logic of menu.But there's a problem that the graph 'J','L' are universal and global in different GUIs which will affect other GUI's logic and give wrong rank result.Considering create a class for the file 'Draw_Graph.py',every GUI will have its own entity so that graph will be private in different GUIs.
